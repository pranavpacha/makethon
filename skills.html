            <h3>Java Programming</h3>
            <p>I acquired a solid foundation in Java programming during my 11th and 12th-grade years through the ISC
                curriculum.
                Having mastered the basics, I am proficient in Java and equipped with the skills to navigate its
                programming intricacies.
                This early exposure laid the groundwork for my expertise in Java, setting the stage for my continued
                growth in the field.

            <h4>HTML/CSS/JS/Web designing</h4>
            <p>I possess a strong foundation in web development, having acquired proficiency in HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript during my initial semester in the Introduction to Web Design course. Through a series of
                projects and activities assigned in college, I continually enhance my skills in web designing. This
                iterative process not only fosters a deep understanding of the subject but also allows me to
                consistently elevate my proficiency. As a result, I can confidently say that I am proficient in these
                technologies and consider myself well-versed in web design.</p>

            <h5>C Programming</h5>
            <p>In my first semester of college, I laid a strong foundation in C programming, mastering its basics.
                Through a myriad of projects and activities assigned in my coursework, I continually honed my skills,
                progressing to the point where I am now proficient and confident in C programming. Each challenge
                presented in college has been a stepping stone, fostering an environment where I consistently improve
                and excel in this essential programming language.</p>

            <h6>Football</h6>
            <p>Passionate about football, I've represented the Karnataka state football team at the nationals,
                showcasing my dedication to the sport. Since middle school, I've been a key player for my school teams,
                earning numerous awards and triumphs in various tournaments. Inspired by Lionel Messi, I strive to
                emulate his work ethic and humility. FC Barcelona holds a special place in my heart as my favorite club.
                Football isn't just a game to me; it's a lifelong commitment. I've not only played but also avidly
                followed football matches throughout my life. While football is my specialty, I'm not confined to a
                single sport. I excel in badminton, basketball, cricket, and sprinting at athletic meets, demonstrating
                my versatility and passion for sports.</p>

            <h1>Networking</h1>
            <p>In the realm of networking, both in the digital and personal spheres, I possess a skill set that extends
                beyond technical expertise. Proficient in forging meaningful connections, I excel in the art of
                networking with people. The joy of meeting and making new connections, coupled with my ability to build
                lasting friendships, is a unique strength. I firmly believe that networking is not only integral to
                personal growth but is also a cornerstone in the professional realm. This conviction fuels my enthusiasm
                to continually expand my network, as I am confident that the relationships I cultivate today will be
                instrumental in shaping future opportunities and success in my career journey.</p>
