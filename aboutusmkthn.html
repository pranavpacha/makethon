                <h3>I am a student at RV University!</h3>
                <p>Greetings! I'm currently pursuing a B.Tech (Hons) in Computer Science Engineering at RV University, where I immerse myself in the dynamic world of technology. Coding is not just a skill for me; it's a passion that I ardently pursue.
                    My interest extends beyond conventional coding, as I am particularly fascinated by the realms of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its applications in various domains. 
                    Exploring the intersection of Artificial Intelligence in sports captivates me, as I am intrigued by how technology can revolutionize the sports industry and I plan to build my career around it. Beyond the realms of academia, I am deeply engrossed in the trifecta of coding, technology, and creativity, seeking innovative ways to blend these elements seamlessly. Join me on my journey of exploration and creation, where technology meets passion in the fascinating world of coding, creativity, and sports.
                </p>
                <h4>Aspirations</h4>
                <p>In the realm of aspirations, my passion lies at the intersection of technology and sports. My ultimate goal is to carve a meaningful career in renowned tech companies, particularly those with a strong emphasis on sports technology. I aspire to contribute significantly to the exciting field of Artificial Intelligence in sports, leveraging cutting-edge technologies to enhance performance, strategy, and the overall sports experience.

                    Looking beyond the horizon, I envisage pursuing a postgraduate MBA from one of the top Ivy League colleges, aiming to refine my business acumen and leadership skills. This strategic academic pursuit will serve as a solid foundation for my ambitions in technology management and entrepreneurship.
                    
                    As I embark on this journey, my vision extends beyond corporate landscapes. Armed with valuable experiences and knowledge, I aspire to channel my entrepreneurial spirit into creating innovative solutions that redefine the dynamics of sports and technology. The synthesis of passion, expertise, and a relentless pursuit of excellence will be my guiding force as I chart a course towards making a lasting impact in the ever-evolving world of technology in sports.</p>
                <h5>Hobbies</h5>
                <p>Outside the realm of academics, I find joy in a diverse range of hobbies that add vibrancy to my life. A devoted football enthusiast, I revel in both playing and watching the beautiful game, with a special affinity for FC Barcelona. Lionel Messi's artistry on the field has not only made him my favorite player but also an enduring source of inspiration. Beyond the football pitch, I am an avid consumer of cinematic experiences. Movies and series, especially those crafted by the visionary Steven Spielberg, captivate my imagination. Exploring the realms of storytelling and visual narrative, Spielberg's work has left an indelible mark on my appreciation for the art of filmmaking. Join me in celebrating the perfect blend of athleticism, art, and storytelling that enriches my academic pursuits and leisurely interests.</p>
